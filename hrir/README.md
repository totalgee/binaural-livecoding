## HRIR files (directional head-related impulse responses)

Put data files here (downloaded from whichever source you want),
and load them as buffers from the SuperCollider code, for convolution.

> In the frequency domain (when impulse responses are Fourier
> transformed), they are known as **HRTFs** (head-related transfer
> functions).
