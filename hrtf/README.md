## HRTF files (impulse responses)

Put data files here (downloaded from whichever source you want),
and load them as buffers from the SuperCollider code, for convolution.

Some downloads that might be tried:

- SADIE -- `D1_BRIR_WAV` or `D1_HRIR_WAV` from https://www.york.ac.uk/sadie-project/database.html
- Listen -- `listen_1002` from http://recherche.ircam.fr/equipes/salles/listen/download.html
- CIPIC -- https://www.ece.ucdavis.edu/cipic/spatial-sound/hrtf-data/
